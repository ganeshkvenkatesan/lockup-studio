This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## S3 cache & environment

- The app uses a server-side in-memory cache of S3 listings and presigned URLs. The cache is initialized on first call to `/api/list-images` and refreshed periodically before presign expiration.
- Environment variables used:
	- `S3_BUCKET` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET` — the S3 bucket name.
	- `S3_ENDPOINT` (optional) — custom S3-compatible endpoint. The server will retry without this endpoint if DNS fails.
	- `PRESIGN_EXPIRATION` (optional) — presigned URL expiry in seconds (default 900).

If you want the listing available at build time, add a build-step to fetch and embed the manifest; currently the server cache is populated on first runtime request.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
